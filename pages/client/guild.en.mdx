# Guild

### 1. Before Start

Because most of the services are powered by OpenAI, you must configure an API key before using them, otherwise they cannot be used properly.

<Image
  className="w-[1920px]"
  src="/client/guild-1.png"
  alt="guild-1"
  width={1920}
  height={1055}
/>

### 2. Configure API Key

You must configure the key before you can use the application properly.

By default, the official OpenAI service is used. If you have your own proxy, you can fill it in the configuration.

If you are not convenient to use the official OpenAI service, you can also try using the [**Le-AI API**](/server/introduction).

<Image
  className="w-[1920px]"
  src="/client/guild-2.png"
  alt="guild-2"
  width={1920}
  height={1055}
/>

### 3. Choose Model

After selecting the appropriate model, you can start the conversation in the input box.

<Image
  className="w-[1920px]"
  src="/client/guild-3.png"
  alt="guild-3"
  width={1920}
  height={1055}
/>
